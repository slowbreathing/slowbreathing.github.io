### Introduction
This is a loss calculating function post the yhat(predicted value) that measures the difference between Labels and predicted value(yhat). Cross entropy is a loss function that is defined as $$\Large E = -y .log ({\hat{Y}})$$ where $$\Large E$$, is defined as the error, $$\Large y$$ is the label and $$\Large \hat{Y}$$ is defined as $$\Large softmax_j (logits)$$ and logits are weighted sum. One of the reason to choose cross entropy alongside softmax is that because softmax has an exponential element inside it the, an element log provides for convex cost function. This is similar to logistic regression which uses sigmoid. Mathematically expressed as below.  

$$\Large \hat{Y}=softmax_j (logits)$$

$$\Large E = -y .log ({\hat{Y}})$$  

where $$ \Large y $$ is the label and Yhat $$\Large \hat{Y}$$ the predicted value.

{% highlight python %}
def loss(pred,labels):
  """
  One at a time.
  args:
      pred-(seq=1),input_size
      labels-(seq=1),input_size
  """
  return np.multiply(labels, -np.log(pred)).sum(1)

Listing-1
{% endhighlight %}
Above is a [loss][loss] implementation.

{% highlight python %}
  x = np.array([[1, 3, 5, 7],
                [1,-9, 4, 8]])
  y = np.array([3,1])
  sm=softmax(x)

  #prints out 0.145
  print(loss(sm[0],input_one_hot(y[0],4)))
  #prints out 17.01
  print(loss(sm[1],input_one_hot(y[1],4)))

Listing-2
{% endhighlight %}

As you can see the loss function accepts softmaxed input and one-hot encoded labels which is being passed in [Listing-2].
The output is illustated in figure-1 and 2 below.

### CrossEntropyLoss
CrossEntropyLoss Function is the same loss function above but simplified and adapted for calculating the loss for multiple time steps as is usually required in RNNs. Infact it calls the same loss function internally. In the above example we are making 2 comparisions because we are passing 2 sets of logits(x) and 2 labels(y). The labels further have to be adapted into a one-hot of 4 so that they can be compared. Assuming that the abobe 2 comparisions are for 2 time timesteps, the abobe results can be achieved by calling the the [CrossEntropyLoss][CrossEntropyLoss] function that calculates the softmax internally.

{% highlight python %}
def cross_entropy_loss(pred,labels):
    """
    Does an internal softmax before loss calculation.
    args:
        pred- batch,seq,input_size
        labels-batch,seq(has to be transformed before comparision with preds(line-133).)
    """
    checkdatadim(pred,3)
    checkdatadim(labels,2)
    batch,seq,size=pred.shape
    yhat=np.zeros((batch,seq,size))

    for batnum in range(batch):
        for seqnum in range(seq):
            yhat[batnum][seqnum]=softmax(np.reshape(pred[batnum][seqnum],[-1,size]))
    lossesa=np.zeros((batch,seq))
    for batnum in range(batch):
        for seqnum in range(seq):
            lossesa[batnum][seqnum]=loss(np.reshape(yhat[batnum][seqnum],[1,-1]),input_one_hot(labels[batnum][seqnum],size))
    return yhat,lossesa

Listing-3
{% endhighlight %}
The point to keep in mind is, it accepts it's 2 inputs in 3(batch,seq,input_size) and 2(batch,seq) dimensions respectively. Batch size usually indicates multiple parallel input sequences, can be ignored for now and be assumed as 1. The shape of pred in our case is batch=1,seq=2,input_size=4. And the shape of labels is batch=1, seq=2. This is illustrated in Listing-3 and Listing-4

{% highlight python %}
  x = np.array([[[1, 3, 5, 7],
                [1,-9, 4, 8]]])
  y = np.array([[3,1]])

  #prints array([[ 0.14507794, 17.01904505]]))
  softmaxed,loss=cross_entropy_loss(x,y)
  print("loss:",loss)

Listing-4
{% endhighlight %}

As illustrated in [Listing-3] and [Listing-4] [Deep-Breathe][Deep-Breathe] version of cross_entropy_loss function returns a tuple of softmaxed output that it calculates internally(only for convenience) and the Loss. The calculated loss, as expected, is the same as before as was while calling the loss function directly.

### CrossEntropyLoss Derivative
One of the tricks I have learnt to get back propagation right is to write the equations backwards. This becomes especially useful when the model is more complex in later articles. A trick that I use a lot.  

$$\Large \hat{Y}=softmax_j (logits)$$

$$\Large E = -y .log ({\hat{Y}})$$  

The above equation is writen like so below while calculating the gradients.

$$\Large E = -y .log ({\hat{Y}})$$

$$\Large \hat{Y}=softmax_j (logits)$$

> * Gradient: Example-3
{%
    include image.html
    src="/img/cel3.jpg"
    caption="figure-3:The red arrow follows the gradient."
    hight="110%"
    width="110%"
%}

> * Deriving the gradients now.  

$$\Large \frac{\partial {E}}{\partial {logits}} = \frac{\partial {E}}{\partial {\hat{Y}}}.\frac{\partial {\hat{Y}}}{\partial {logits}}$$  

# <a name="eq-2"></a>  

$$\Large \frac{\partial {E}}{\partial {logits}} = -\frac{y}{\hat{y}}.\frac{\partial {\hat{Y}}}{\partial {logits}} \:\:\:\: eq(2)$$  

> * For calculating $$\Large \frac{\partial {\hat{Y}}}{\partial {logits}}$$ where $$\Large \hat{y}$$ is the softmax and its derivative is given by [eq-1][eq-1]. Combining [eq-1][eq-1] and [eq-2][eq-2].  

$$\Large \frac{\partial {E}}{\partial {logits}} = -\frac{y}{\hat{y}}.\begin{Bmatrix}
softmax_i(1-softmax_j) & i= j \\
{-softmax_j}.{softmax_i} & i\neq j
\end{Bmatrix}$$  

$$\Large \frac{\partial {E}}{\partial {logits}} = -\frac{y}{\hat{y}}.\hat{y_t}.(1-\hat{y_t}) + \sum_{i\neq j}(\frac{-y_t}{\hat{y_t}})(-\hat{y_t}\hat{y_t})$$  

$$\Large \frac{\partial {E}}{\partial {logits}} = -y.(1-\hat{y_t}) + \sum_{i\neq j}y_t.\hat{y_t}$$  

$$\Large \frac{\partial {E}}{\partial {logits}} = -y+y.\hat{y_t} + \sum_{i\neq j}y_t.\hat{y_t}$$  

$$\Large \frac{\partial {E}}{\partial {logits}} = y.\hat{y_t} + \sum_{i\neq j}y_t.\hat{y_t} -y$$  

$$\Large \frac{\partial {E}}{\partial {logits}} = \hat{y_t}.(y + \sum_{i\neq j}y_t) -y $$  

Since Y is a one hot vector, the term "$$\Large (y + \sum_{i\neq j}y_t)$$" sums up to one.  

# <a name="eq-3"></a>
$$\Large \frac{\partial {E}}{\partial {logits}} = (\hat{y_t} -y) \:\:\:\: eq(3) $$

### CrossEntropyLoss Derivative implementation
{% highlight python %}
  softmaxed,loss=cross_entropy_loss(x,y)
  print("loss:",loss)

  batch,seq,size=x.shape
  target_one_hot=np.zeros((batch,seq,size))
  # Adapting the shape of Y
  for batnum in range(batch):
    for i in range(seq):
        target_one_hot[batnum][i]=input_one_hot(y[batnum][i],size)
  dy = softmaxed.copy()
  dy = dy - target_one_hot
  # prints out gradient: [[[ 2.14400878e-03  1.58422012e-02  1.17058913e-01 -1.35045123e-01]
  #                        [ 8.94679461e-04 -9.99999959e-01  1.79701173e-02  9.81135163e-01]]]
  print("gradient:",dy)

### Summary
As you can see idea behind softmax and cross_entropy_loss and their combined use and implementation. Also their combined gradient derivation is one the most used formulas in deep learning. Implemented code often lends perspective into theory as you see the various shapes of input and output. Hopefully cross_entropy_loss's combined gradient in Listing-5 does the same.
